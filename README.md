Pyramid Adversary Profiling :

This repository presents an interactive dashboard that demonstrates the Pyramid of Adversary Profilingâ€”a structured framework for analyzing cyber threats. The pyramid breaks down adversary actions into five critical components:

Who: The identity and behavioral signatures of the threat actor.
Why: The underlying motivation and intent behind the attack.
What: The targeted assets and critical data under threat.
How: The methods and techniques used to execute the attack.
When: The timing and conditions exploited to launch the attack.

Features:
